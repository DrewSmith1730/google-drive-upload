# Google Drive Upload ( OCI )

## This was the project I worked on at this internship while I was in my senior year of highschool
## I spent my time here learning the basics of a software engineers day and learned the basics of the html and css along with learning git along with these this was my first intro to learning code from an already existing project.
## This time was very informative and while also being a very nice introduction from a younger age to work of software and made it a real interest in my life.
